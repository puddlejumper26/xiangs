This blog is the record of building a website by myself.

I owned a website year ago, but it was written in JS, now I would like to re-write it through new tools. Main reason behind, is because name-cheap is too nasty..

This blog is going to take record of every detailed step.

- Angular
- Angular Material
-- Angular FlexLayout (https://blog.poychang.net/use-angular-flex-layout-package/)
- SCSS
