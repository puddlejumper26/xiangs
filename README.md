<h1 align="center"> Xiangs Webstie </h1>
This blog is the record of building a website by myself.

I owned a website year ago, but it was written in JS, now I would like to re-write it through new tools. Main reason behind, is because name-cheap is too nasty..

This blog is going to take record of every detailed step.

## Frame + Tool
- Angular
- Angular Material
-- Angular FlexLayout (https://blog.poychang.net/use-angular-flex-layout-package/)
- SCSS
- VS Code

## Website Structures

It is a *Single Page Application*, taking references from [Angular Material ](https://material.angular.io/components/categories) to decide which component should generate

- Navbar ( Breadcrum) (Deprecated)<br>
- Sidebar<br>
-- Home<br>
-- About<br>
-- Projects<br>
-- Showcases (directly to github page)<br>
-- Blog (directly to github page)<br>
-- Contacts<br>
- Products ( to display all contents)<br>
- Footer<br>
- 404<br>
